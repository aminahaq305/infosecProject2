The Haq_Project3.cpp file can be used on bender.cs.wright.edu to decrypt a file through brute force search for the first four bytes of the key that are unknown.

First compile the Haq_Project3.cpp file using the following command:
  cryptog++ Haq_Project3.cpp -lcryptopp -o bruteforce

Use the compiled file to decrypt using the following command
  cryptoexec ./bruteforce <inputfile> <outputfile>
where: 
   <inputfile> represents the file containing the ciphertext to be decrypted using brute force
   <outputfile> represents the file to which the plaintext produced will be written
  
Example code to decrypt file 00_e and write plaintext produced to 00_r
  cryptoexec ./bruteforce 00_e 00_r
